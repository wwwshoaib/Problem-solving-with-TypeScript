# TypeScript Basic Problem-Solving 


## General Rules
Do not change the function names. Use the exact name given in each problem.
Every problem must be solved using a function.
Every function must return a value. Do not use console.log() as the final answer.
Use appropriate TypeScript types for function parameters, function return values, objects, arrays, and union types where appropriate.
Avoid using any unless a problem explicitly requires it.
You may use JavaScript/ES6 features such as map(), filter(), reduce(), find(), includes(), destructuring, and template literals.
Test your functions with the provided examples and create a few additional test cases yourself.
Think about edge cases before considering a problem completely.



## Problem 1 — Cinema Ticket Counter
Concepts: function parameter types, return types, number, conditional logic
Function name must be: getTicketPrice

Scenario
A cinema is building a ticketing system. The ticket price depends on the customer's age because children and senior citizens receive special pricing. You are responsible for creating the function that determines how much a customer should pay for a single ticket.

Task
Create a function named getTicketPrice. The function should receive the customer's age and return the appropriate ticket price.

Pricing Rules
Age
Ticket Price
Below 5
0
5–12
100
13–59
200
60 or above
120

A child younger than 5 years old can enter for free.

Function Requirement
Accept the age as a number.
Return the ticket price as a number.
Correctly handle all age ranges.

Starter Code
function getTicketPrice(age:<type>): <type> {
 
    // write your code here
 
}
Example
getTicketPrice(3);
// 0
 
getTicketPrice(10);
// 100
 
getTicketPrice(25);
// 200
 
getTicketPrice(65);
// 120

## Problem 2 — Store Inventory Status
Concepts: function types, number, string, conditional logic, boundary conditions
Function name must be: getStockStatus
Scenario
An online store wants to show customers whether a product is available before they place an order. The inventory system stores the number of currently available units. Your job is to convert that number into a meaningful status message.
Task
Create a function named getStockStatus. The function receives the current stock quantity and returns a status string.
Status Rules
Stock
Status
0
"Out of Stock"
1–5
"Almost Sold Out"
6–20
"Available"
More than 20
"In Stock"

Additional Requirement
The function should return a string.

Think carefully about boundary values such as:
Starter Code
function getStockStatus(stock:<type>): <type>{
 
    // write your code here
 
}
Example
getStockStatus(0);
// "Out of Stock"
 
getStockStatus(3);
// "Almost Sold Out"
 
getStockStatus(12);
// "Available"
 
getStockStatus(50);
// "In Stock"
 
// boundary values to double-check:
getStockStatus(5);
getStockStatus(6);
getStockStatus(20);
getStockStatus(21);

## Problem 3 — Social Media Profile Formatter
Concepts: object types, type/interface, function parameter typing, return types, template literals
Function name must be: formatUserProfile
Scenario
A social media application stores basic information about its users. The application needs a function that converts a user's structured data into a human-readable profile summary. A user contains name, age, and city.
Task
First define an appropriate TypeScript type or interface for the user. Then create a function named formatUserProfile. The function should receive a user object and return a formatted sentence.
Requirements
Accept a properly typed user object.
Return a string.
Use the values from the object rather than hard-coding the result.

Starter Code
// TODO: define a type or interface for the user
 
function formatUserProfile(user: User): <type> {
 
    // write your code here
 
}


Example
formatUserProfile({
    name: "Fahim",
    age: 22,
    city: "Dhaka"
});
 
// Expected output:
// "Fahim is 22 years old and lives in Dhaka."

## Problem 4 — Shopping Cart Calculator
Concepts: object types, array types, reduce(), function parameter and return types
Function name must be: calculateCartTotal
Scenario
An online shopping website stores each item in a customer's cart as an object containing its name and price. The store needs a function that calculates the total price of all products currently in the cart.
Product Structure
{
    name: string;
    price: number;
}
Task
Create a function named calculateCartTotal. The function should receive an array of products and return the total price.
Requirements
Properly type the product object.
Properly type the array of products.
Return the total as a number.
An empty cart should return 0.
Starter Code
// TODO: define a type for a single product
 
function calculateCartTotal(products: Product[]): <type> {
 
    // write your code here
 
}
Example
const products = [
    { name: "Keyboard", price: 1500 },
    { name: "Mouse", price: 800 },
    { name: "USB Cable", price: 300 }
];
 
calculateCartTotal(products);
// 2600
 
// another example:
const products2 = [
    { name: "Book", price: 500 },
    { name: "Pen", price: 50 },
    { name: "Bag", price: 1200 }
];
 
calculateCartTotal(products2);
// 1750

## Problem 5 — Student Result Analyzer
Concepts: nested arrays, object types, reduce(), return object types, conditional logic
Function name must be: getStudentResult
Scenario
A school stores the marks of each student in an array. Teachers want a quick summary containing the student's name, average mark, and whether the student passed or failed. A student is considered passed if their average mark is at least 40.
Student Structure
{
    name: string;
    marks: number[];
}
Task
Create a function named getStudentResult. The function should receive a student object, calculate the average of all marks, determine whether the student passed, and return a new object containing name, average, and result.
Edge Case
Think about what your function should do if the marks array is empty.
Starter Code
// TODO: define a type for a student
 
function getStudentResult(student: Student): <type> {
 
    // write your code here
 
}
Example
getStudentResult({
    name: "Rafi",
    marks: [80, 75, 90, 85]
});
 
// Expected output:
// { name: "Rafi", average: 82.5, result: "Passed" }
 
// another example:
getStudentResult({
    name: "Nabil",
    marks: [30, 35, 40, 25]
});
 
// Expected output:
// { name: "Nabil", average: 32.5, result: "Failed" }

## Problem 6 — Role-Based Permission Checker
Concepts: union types, literal types, function parameter types, type safety
Function name must be: canEdit
Scenario
A web application has three types of users: admin, editor, and viewer. Different roles have different permissions. For this problem, only administrators and editors are allowed to edit content.
Task
First create a union type Role, then create a function named canEdit that receives a valid Role and returns whether that role can edit content.
Rules
Role
Can Edit?
admin
true
editor
true
viewer
false

TypeScript Requirement
This should produce a TypeScript error — canEdit("guest") — since the purpose is to make TypeScript restrict the function to known roles.
Starter Code


 
function canEdit(role: Role): <type> {
 
    // write your code here
 
}
Example
canEdit("admin");
// true
 
canEdit("editor");
// true
 
canEdit("viewer");
// false

## Problem 7 — Product Category Search
Concepts: typed arrays, object types, function parameters, filter(), return types
Function name must be: findProducts
Scenario
An e-commerce platform contains thousands of products. A customer selects a category, and the application needs to show only the products belonging to that category. Each product has a name, price, and category.
Task
Create a function named findProducts. The function should receive an array of products and a category, and return all products that belong to that category.
Requirement
If no product matches the category, return an empty array.
Starter Code
// TODO: define a type for a product (including category)
 
function findProducts(products: Product[], category: <type>): <type> {
 
    // write your code here
 
}
Example
const products = [
    { name: "iPhone 15", price: 90000, category: "phone" },
    { name: "Galaxy S24", price: 85000, category: "phone" },
    { name: "MacBook Air", price: 120000, category: "laptop" },
    { name: "Dell XPS", price: 110000, category: "laptop" }
];
 
findProducts(products, "phone");
// returns the iPhone 15 and Galaxy S24 objects
 
findProducts(products, "laptop");
// returns the two laptop products

## Problem 8 — Hospital Patient Status
Concepts: union types, optional properties, type narrowing, discriminated unions, object types
Function name must be: getPatientStatus
Scenario
A hospital has two types of patients: general patients and emergency patients. General patients only have basic information. Emergency patients have an additional emergencyLevel.
General Patient
{
    name: "Rahim",
    age: 35,
    type: "general"
}
Emergency Patient
{
    name: "Karim",
    age: 60,
    type: "emergency",
    emergencyLevel: 1
}
Emergency levels are: 1 → Critical, 2 → Serious, 3 → Moderate.
Task
Create a function named getPatientStatus. The function should receive either a general patient or an emergency patient and return an appropriate status message.

TypeScript Requirement
Use TypeScript's type system to represent the fact that emergencyLevel exists for emergency patients but not necessarily for general patients.

Starter Code
// TODO: define types for GeneralPatient and EmergencyPatient
 
function getPatientStatus(patient: GeneralPatient | EmergencyPatient): <type> {
 
    // write your code here
 
}
Example
getPatientStatus({ name: "Rahim", age: 35, type: "general" });
// "General patient"
 
getPatientStatus({ name: "Karim", age: 60, type: "emergency", emergencyLevel: 1 });
// "Critical emergency"
 
getPatientStatus({ name: "Hasan", age: 45, type: "emergency", emergencyLevel: 3 });
// "Moderate emergency"

## Problem 9 — Bank Transaction Processor
Concepts: union types, discriminated unions, type narrowing, object types, return types, conditional logic
Function name must be: processTransaction
Scenario
A banking application needs to process deposits and withdrawals. Every transaction contains a type and an amount.
Deposit
{
    type: "deposit",
    amount: 2000
}
Withdrawal
{
    type: "withdraw",
    amount: 1500
}
Task
Create a function named processTransaction. It should receive the current account balance and a transaction, and return the new balance.
Rules
A deposit increases the balance.
A withdrawal decreases the balance.
A customer cannot withdraw more money than they currently have — in that case, the original balance should remain unchanged.
TypeScript Requirement
Represent the two possible transaction shapes using TypeScript's type system. The function should not accept arbitrary transaction types.
Starter Code
// TODO: define types for Deposit and Withdrawal transactions
 
function processTransaction(balance: <type>, transaction: Deposit | Withdrawal): <type> {
 
    // write your code here
 
}
Example
processTransaction(5000, { type: "deposit", amount: 2000 });
// 7000
 
processTransaction(5000, { type: "withdraw", amount: 2000 });
// 3000
 
// insufficient balance:
processTransaction(5000, { type: "withdraw", amount: 7000 });
// 5000  (unchanged) 
// insufficient balance


Recommended Solving Strategy
For every problem, follow this sequence:
Step 1 — Understand the Input
Ask: What exactly does my function receive?
function calculateCartTotal(products: Product[]): number
Step 2 — Define the Data Types
If objects are involved, define their structure first.
type Product = {
    name: string;
    price: number;
};
Step 3 — Define the Function
Clearly specify the parameter types and the return type.
function calculateCartTotal(products: Product[]): number {
    // solution
}
Step 4 — Solve the JavaScript Logic
Don't overthink TypeScript. First determine the algorithm:
products
   -> take each price
   -> add them
   -> return total
Step 5 — Use TypeScript to Make the Solution Safer
Can this value have multiple types?
Are there only a few valid values?
Can a property be missing?
What exactly should the function return?
Step 6 — Test Edge Cases
Don't only test the provided examples. For example:
calculateCartTotal([]);
 
findProducts(products, "tablet");
 
getTicketPrice(5);
getTicketPrice(12);
getTicketPrice(13);
